    <h1>All About Me (Mark)</h1>
    <p>I consider my life to be full of action and adventure, especially during the summer. Almost every summer I 
        make a trip to a local bike park in Queens or to the Blue Mountain trails in Pennsylvania. When I'm not on my mountain bike, I am most likely doing these things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing Valorant, GTA, and Cities Skylines</li>
        <li>Spending time with friends outside</li>
        <li>Learning Fantaisie Impromptu on the piano</li>
        <li>Going to the beach</li>
        <li>Studying physics (not so fun)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Homie</h2>
    <p>About a year ago, I made the best financial decision: purchasing a bird. His name is Peter, and he's the best pet I could ever ask for. I always play with him while
        I'm at home, and he even watches videos online with me. I observed how much he loved each social media website I watch and like, and ranked them (1 is best, descending):

    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></li>
        
    </ol>
    <p>Here is the website from which I learned all about Peter:</p>
